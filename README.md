## Side?
Client Side only, has no function server side.

## Development?
Super casual. Currently in beta.

## Goal?
A coordinates mod that gives you control over the meaning of those funny little numbers.
Y=0 used to mean 'the bottom of the world'. Now it just means 'somewhere in the ground'. Now it can mean whatever you want, but I made this mod with the intention of Y=0 referring to sea level, so you could say for Y=-33 "I am 33 metres below sea level!" or for Y=24 "I am at an altitude of 24 metres!". The config defaults to this.
XZ coords being measured by the metre is unnecessarily precise in many cases, so you can switch between block and chunk based coords. You can even shift the X,Z=0 to the spawn point, or wherever you built your base!

This mod is able to translate coords written in chat to whatever system you're using. You can use /cc share <coords> (<coords> is optional, it will share your current coords otherwise) to send out coordinates from your system in their true in-game form.

## Compatibility
Integrates with [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap)
Shouldn't have issues with any mod. Let me know if it does.

## Current stage?
Currently awaiting review for the beta build. You can clone it off the github though.
